#### Markdown Basics for README Creation

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax that can be converted to HTML. It is the most common one used for writing READMEs on GitHub. Markdown allows you to create headers, lists, links, and other text features with simple symbols.

```markdown
# Header 1

## Header 2

### Header 3

- List item
- Another item
  [Link text](https://example.com)
```
